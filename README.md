# Used Car Prices Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze used car sales data to identify key factors influencing the selling prices of used cars. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression analysis, we seek to uncover trends and relationships within the data that can provide insights for sellers, buyers, and dealerships.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression Analysis to predict car selling prices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. This project also requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://yourrepositorylink.git
cd your-project-directory
```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- On Windows, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install the required packages:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Usage
To run the analysis, navigate to the project directory and execute the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your script. This will perform the data cleaning, EDA, and regression analysis, outputting the results to your terminal or saving them as files, depending on how you've set up your script.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the analysis or extend the project are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-branch-PR workflow.

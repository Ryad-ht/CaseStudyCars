#Used Car Prices Analysis
##Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze used car sales data to identify key factors influencing the selling prices of used cars. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression analysis, we seek to uncover trends and relationships within the data that can provide insights for sellers, buyers, and dealerships.

##Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Regression Analysis to predict car selling prices

##Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. This project also requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

##Installation
###Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://yourrepositorylink.git
cd your-project-directory

###Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv

###On Windows, activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate

###On macOS and Linux, activate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate

###Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

###Usage
To run the analysis, navigate to the project directory and execute the main Python script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Replace main.py with the actual name of your script. This will perform the data cleaning, EDA, and regression analysis, outputting the results to your terminal or saving them as files, depending on how you've set up your script.
